# Portage

Portage, the successor to **Pop** and **gitstrap**.

Portage provies a package system reliant on git and bash to build any package you desire!

## Installation

To install portage for the first time, use meson. (You also must have a D Compiler)

```
meson builddir
cd builddir
ninja install
```

After that, just run `portage upgrade` to get updates every single week!

Portage will ALWAYS get matinence updates so at least run the `upgrade` command once every two weeks :)
